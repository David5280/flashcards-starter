# FlashCards 

## Project Details

This is the first solo project of module two at the Turing School of Software and Design.  After being given a starter kit with certain files already completed *(data.js, util.js)*, I built code for multiple class objects *(card.js, turn.js, deck.js, round,js, & game.js)* to complete the functionability of this terminal application.  Additionally, I built the code for the testing suite (card-test.js, turn-test.js, deck-test.js, etc...) that verified the funcitonability of my code before the application itself was at a functional state.   The goals of this project were as follows:

-Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
-Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
-Implement ES6 classes
-Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
-Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Set-up

Once this repo has been forked and cloned, this application can be accessed by navigating to the 'Flashcards' root directory in your computers command line.  Once there, the command 'node index.js' will initialize the application.  The first question will be displayed, and the answer can be selected with the enter button after using the arrow buttons to select the correct answer.  Once all questions have been answered, a message will display notifying the user of the end of the game, as well as the percentage of questions that they answered correctly.
